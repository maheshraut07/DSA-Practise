/*
Encapsulation = wrapping up data and functions in a single 
                entity called as class

            if all members are private then we called as pure encapsulatioin
                
Advantages = 1) Data Hiding
             2) we can make class read only
             3) Code reusability
             4) Used in Unit Testing*/
