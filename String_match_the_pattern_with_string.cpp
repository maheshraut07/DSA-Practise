/*
Given two strings, one is a text string, txt and other is a pattern string, pat. The task is to print the indexes of all the occurences of pattern string in the text string. Use one-based indexing while returing the indices. 
Note: Return an empty list incase of no occurences of pattern. Driver will print -1 in this case.

Example 1:

Input:
txt = "geeksforgeeks"
pat = "geek"
Output: 
1 9
Explanation: 
The string "geek" occurs twice in txt, one starts are index 1 and the other at index 9. 
Example 2:

Input: 
txt = "abesdu"
pat = "edu"
Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
There's not substring "edu" present in txt.
